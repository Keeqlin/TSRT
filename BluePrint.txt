Configuration:
	FPS:
		Inpute video: 30, Chris-Net: ~20
	TSR type:
		tetragon, triangle, inverted triangle, hexagon, dash-lane
	Average car velocity: 120 km/hr (33.33 m/s)

Goal:
	The overall TSR system should be operate over 30 FPS
	Acquiring detection result of Chris-Net in 10Hz(Tracking 200ms)
	Improving precision and recall by tracking algorithm





Scenario:
	Multiple object,
		without occulsion between tragets(data association concern)
	rigid-static tracking,
	Monocular camera,
	Non-stationary enviorment,
		High way,
		city(false positve elimination:prior of spatial distribution map),
Charateristic:
	Temporal correlation,
	incermental framework for considering motion and apperane model simultaneously

Difficulity:
	backgroun, illumination, occlusion

Advantages againts deep learning method:
	expensive resources(costs, computation, hardware, dataset)
	background change
	object modeling (Solution: online adaptive learned detector)
Disadvantages of deep learning method:
	Poor generalizatoin ability ver unseen enviorments
	can not capture the variation of the traget under non-stationary enviorment


Motion FIltering: update and predict the tracking frames
	measurement: detection result of offline-detector

Incremental frame:
	on-lime collector exames the credibility of predicted results by motion model
		confident
		not congident
		Q: How to decide the confindeness of predicted result?
			symmetry magnitude
			appearance deviation
			pixel distance between previous target
